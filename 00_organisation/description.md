#PyroGraph

Created by Bjørn Karmann, Nicolas Armand and Lars Kaltenbach, aka Machine Porn, *PyroGraph* is a big scale experimental plotter which uses a soldering iron to burn images into paper.

Inspired by traditional receipt printers used in every shops the *PyroGraph* analyses any image and converts it into dots. These dots are then burned with a 450 °C tip onto paper. The time of contact between the iron and the paper determines the greyscale of the dot. The longer it presses against the paper, the darker the dots get.
The machine uses a paper roll (so the length of the printed piece can then be up to 100m) and a head moving on a fixed x axis, controlled by motors and a software we’re developing.  

The PyroGraph is designed for laying and hanging use. Hanging the *PyroGraph* conveys a strong verticality to the piece, that would perfectly match with Kraftwerk's high ceilings.

The process being slower than a traditional printer, the installation could run during the whole festival length to print a monumental continuous piece.
