#PyroGraph

Created by Bjørn Karmann, Nicolas Armand and Lars Kaltenbach, PyroGraph is an experimental plotter which uses a soldering iron to burn images into paper.

Inspired by traditional heat printers used in every supermarket the PyroGraph analyses a given bitmap image and converts it into dots. These dots are then burned with a 450 °C soldering iron into paper. The time of contact between the iron and the paper determines the greyscale of the dot. The longer it presses against the paper, the darker the dots get.  

The PyroGraph is designed for laying and hanging use and works with the help of Processing, Arduino, an old soldering iron and a few motors.
